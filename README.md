# Abstract

Our goal was to understand and
implement facial recognition algorithms in
python using the various facial recognition
algorithms. Namely, Eigenfaces,
Fisherfaces and Local Binary Patterns
Histograms (LBPH). We have mainly done
this using the free OpenCV library. These
algorithms all use Principal Components
Analysis (PCA) to identify and predict
faces.

We have imported the OpenCV library in
Python and used OpenCV tools along with
many inbuilt Python tools to implement facial
recognition. All our methods primarily rely on
two basic steps. First we feed the machine a
set of sample faces so it can learn what our
faces look like. Then we test the facial
recognizer using sample faces. Our sample
faces can be given in forms of live video, or
captured images, or images captured at
runtime.

This particular project shows the way a simple
face unlock mechanism can be built using OpenCV.
